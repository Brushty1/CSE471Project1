<h1>Additive Synthesizer</h1>
<p>Owned by: Tyler Brush</p>

<p>The additive synthesizer that I created adds the sine waves from 8 different harmonics together and plays the resulting audio. For each wave you can specify the harmonic and the amplitude. The additive synthesizer also uses ADSR and allows for the attack, decay, and release all to be set (with the sustain phase being the leftover portion)</p>
