<h2>Score Format</h2>
<p>​The format of my score files is very similar to that from step 5. The top most level tag is a score tag which contains the bpm and beats per measure. It then has instrument tag children that contain the name of the instrument. For my project, the additive synthesizer instrument tag has harmonics tag children which contain has the measure, duration, attack, decay, and release of the note played by the harmonics. Lastly, the harmonics tag has 8 children harmonic tags that describe the harmonic and the amplitude.</p>
